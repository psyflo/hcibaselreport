# Abstract

# Introduction
In [@Stodden2014], authors mentioned Word tables as one of the
obstacles to effective collaboration.

# Method

## Measures

```{r overview-doc-prep, tab.cap="Overview of questionnaire", fig.width = 6}
df.items <- data.frame(number = 1:9,item = row.names(Thurstone.33))
ft <- flextable(df.items)
ft <- add_footer_lines(ft, "Items and wordings used in this study.")
ft
```



## Procedure
## Participants

# Results

```{r fa-pattern-matrix, tab.cap="Loadings of items on factors"}
fa.out <- fa(Thurstone.33,2)
df <- data.frame(unclass(fa.out$loadings), h2=fa.out$communalities, u2= fa.out$uniqueness,com=fa.out$complexity)
flextable(round(df,2))
```
